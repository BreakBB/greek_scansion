# Basic usage

You can perform annotations directly by calling `annotate.py`:

`python annotate.py <input file> <output file>`

This script expects input data to be in a tab-separated format (verse id, verse text), one verse per line. The script performs preprocessing (lowercasing, removal of diacritics, and syllabification) on each verse. On the basis of the number of syllables found in each verse, dedicated finite-state machines then handle the hexameter annotation.

# Classes

You can also write your own annotation script using the following classes.

## Preprocessing package

### Selector class

This is mainly custom code that I used for randomly selecting a subset of verses from the corpus. Unlikely to be of interest for you.

### Preprocessor class

#### Method normalise

This method removes diacritics, accents, and lowercases the whole verse.

#### Syllabification
I have experimented with various approaches to syllabification. For example, the method `simple_syllabify` uses James Tauber's library. The method `papakitsos_syllabify`worked best for me and is also used by `annotate.py`.

The method `count_syllables` returns the syllable count.

## hAutomata package

### Class ruleset

This class contains the linguistic rules used for annotation. There are only 5 very simple rules. The finite-state machines all contain the ruleset as a class member, so if you use them for annotation, your annotation script does not need to import this class.

### Class verse

Contains the verse model. Instances of this class also serve as members of the finite-state machines.

### Class annotator

This is the parent class for the hierarchical finite-state machines. Its functions are only called internally, so there is (normally) no need for calling it directly from the annotation script.

### Hierarchical finite-state machines

These implement the complete annotation process. Before using a machine, reset it by calling `<machinename>.to_waiting()`. The analysis is started by calling `<machinename>.start_analysis()`. The correction process is started by calling `<machinename>.not_found()`.

## Transducer package

This package contains the `fallbackTransducer` class, an HFST finite-state transducer. It takes a partly annotated hexameter string (e. g. -?? -- -- -- -? ??) and calculates its possible solutions. The transducer is accesible to the finite-state machines of the hAutomata package as a class member and it is called through its `apply` function.

# Further code

`baseline.py` tries to compute a baseline annotation, but, as said earlier, the CLTK baseline is not realistic. 

`export_from_db.py` is custom code for exporting verses from my relational database. If necessary, you might modify it according to your needs.
